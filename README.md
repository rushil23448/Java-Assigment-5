# Java-Assigment-5
# Shape Calculator

## Overview
This Java program calculates the area, perimeter, surface area, and volume of various shapes such as Circle, Rectangle, Square, Sphere, Cylinder, and Pyramid. It presents a menu-driven interface allowing users to choose the shape they want to calculate properties for.

## Description
The program consists of a `Main` class that contains the main menu-driven logic to interact with the shapes. Each shape is represented by a separate class (`Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Square`, `Sphere`, `Cylinder`, and `Pyramid`). Each shape class has methods to calculate its area, perimeter, surface area, and volume. The program uses a loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit.

## Usage
1. Run the `Main.java` file.
2. Follow the menu prompts to select the shape for which you want to calculate properties.
3. Enter the required dimensions when prompted.
4. The program will display the calculated area, perimeter, surface area, and volume of the selected shape.
5. Choose option 7 to exit the program.
